## About
This is a program made as part of my IB Computer Science IA, in which students are required to code a solution to a real-world problem.

My program will automate many processes associated with school fencing, such as recording results (scoresheet virtualisation), ranking (sorting) fencers based on performance in the previous round, poule allocation, and direct elimination tableau formulation.
