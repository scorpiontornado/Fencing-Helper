## About
This is a program made as part of my IB Computer Science IA, in which students are required to code a solution to a real-world problem.

My program will automate many processes associated with school fencing.

It addresses the following success criteria:
1.	A fencing coach must be able to input a list of fencers for a given event from a file into the system so that they can organise the fencing event
2.	A fencer must be able to input raw bout results for a specified poule via a keyboard directly into the program
3.	The program must be able to generate fencer rankings for a given round to save the coachesâ€™ time and reduce the potential for error
4.	A fencing coach must be able to automatically allocate fencers to poules based on the fencer rankings to save time and reduce the potential for error
5.	A fencing coach must be able to display fencer rankings so that they can manually formulate a direct elimination tableau (DE tableau)
